        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");

            ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "<em>I used to be a very happy fellow </em>until the <strong>Donald Trump</strong> won the election.";
            ohnoesSays.style.backgroundColor = "green";
            ohnoesSays.style.color = "white";
            winstonSays.textContent = "Oh Noes my friend is so sad because he does not like the president";
        </script>
